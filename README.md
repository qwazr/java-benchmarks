### JAVA benchmarks

This project is about JAVA code benchmarking.

It is common to have several options when coming to the implementation.

This set of benchmark aims to compare different alternative code implementations for commons basics tasks.

The benchmark are made with [JMH - Java Microbenchmark Harness](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/).

The project is a typical JAVA [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) project.

To run it, just use the following command:

    gradle jmh
